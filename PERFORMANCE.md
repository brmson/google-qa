GoogleQA Performance Analysis
=============================

Using our **moviesC-test** dataset, Google was asked 233 questions, answering
198 of them, but we deem just 140 questions as answered correctly.
We tested this by matching our results against the gold standard answers in the dataset.
Whenever we encountered a list of answers (e.g. a list a movies),
*any one match* would count the question as answered correctly.
The accuracy is thus **60.0858369099%**.

The mechanical comparison was done using gold_standard_comparison.py:

	python gold_standard_comparison.py moviesC-test.json moviesC-test-google.json

Dataset Noise
-------------

Some of the questions judged as answered wrongly are not the fault of Google
but of our dataset or the matching procedure.  We do not count these in Google's
favor in the total accuracy, as other systems automatically evaluated using this
dataset will have the same trouble.  Still, a detailed analysis of dataset
mistakes follows:

In total, **40 questions** seem to be true Google mistakes to us,
while **18 questions** were dataset or matching problems.

8 questions had the answer in a wrong date format,
case or missed a substring. For example, "When was Fight Club produced" returned "1999", while the GS expected "1999-09-10", 
"Piano" didn't match against "piano" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" didn't match "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"

After further analysis, we deemed 10 questions in our gold standard to be factually incorrect. Google answered correctly in those cases.
